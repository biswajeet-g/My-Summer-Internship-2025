# SI-2025 : Analog IC Design

This repository documents my work as a student from **Silicon University** during a three-week Analog IC Design Internship in June 2025, under the mentorship of **Dr.Saroj Rout**

As an aspiring Analog IC designer, I explored the complete design flow from system level specification to schematic design, simulation, and layout using open source tools like **Xschem, NGSpice, Magic VLSI, and Netgen, based on the Skywater 130nm CMOS technology.**

The core focus was the Analog Front-End (AFE) design for a USB Microphone, along with essential analog building blocks like current mirrors, differential amplifiers, and folded cascode opamps. Simulations and characterization were also supported using Python.

This repository serves as a consolidated and version-controlled record of my learning, simulations, and project implementation.
